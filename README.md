PHP SimplePDF
=============

Currently it's just refactored version of [FPDF](http://www.fpdf.org/).
I made this modification for my personal use.
The goal is to provide cleaner codebase, better APIs, and better support for PHP 8.
Currently I don't have plan to add new features on this. 
Use it with your own risk.

## Installation

```bash
composer require emsifa/simple-pdf:dev-main
```

## Usage

See `examples` directory.
